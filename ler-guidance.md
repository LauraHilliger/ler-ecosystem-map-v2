<h2 class="">GUIDANCE ON LERs</h2>


<div>
<p>For LERs to be effective at scale, they must be able to function across a variety of systems where individuals may seek to use their employment and education data. In other words, they must be interoperable. By leveraging new technologies, LERs are reshaping not only what is recorded about a learnerâ€™s accomplishments, knowledge, skills, and capabilities, but how learners can access and use their data to pursue employment and further education without barriers.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need shared guidance for decision makers involved in LERs. The following recommendations for the development of LERs follow key principles from the <a href ="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model" target=_"blank"> W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>, a widely referenced data standard containing properties commonly found in physical credentials. </p>

<p> <a href ="https://www.c-ben.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CBEN-23-003-Interoperable-Learning-WALMART-V2.pdf" target="_blank">The Competency Based Education Network Interoperability Principles </a> offer guidance and key design elements for optimal LER systems. Recognition and adherence to these principles is encouraged for technology vendors and other decision makers within the ecosystem.

<div>
	<p><strong>OPEN STANDARDS</strong></p>
	<p>Data included in LERs are formatted using a standard structure, allowing for easy exchange between individuals, education, and employment.</p>

	<p><strong>OPEN STANDARDS</strong></p>
	<p></p>

</div>

<div>
	<p><strong>PRIVACY AND SECURITY</strong></p>
	<p>Systems protect the privacy and security of individuals' data, which, in turn, builds and maintains trust in LERs.</p>

</div>


 <div>
	<p><strong>UNLOCKING LEARNING ANYWHERE</strong></p>
	<p>Learning is lifelong, and quality learning can occur outside of the classroom. Interoperable LERs honor the value of all learning and offer processes for validating a wide range of learning, skills, and competencies.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p><strong>GLOBAL MOBILITY</strong></p>
	<p>Interoperable LERs support learners' mobility by functioning in local, regional, state, national, and global talent marketplaces.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p><strong>UNIVERSAL ACCESS</strong></p>
	<p>Interoperable LERs are user-centered and ensure every potential user has access to and control over a digital wallet to store, manage, and curate LERs.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p><strong>ALIGNMENT</strong></p>
	<p>All stakeholders, including employers, states, and local, regional and, federal agencies, are aligned, intentionally collaborating to support and ensure fidelity to interoperability principles.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p><strong>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS CREATING PUBLIC GOOD</strong></p>
	<p>A healthy marketplace is cultivated and regulated to both encourage innovation and ensure that the benefits of interoperable LERs are shared by all stakeholders.</p>
