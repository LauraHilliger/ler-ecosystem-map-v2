#list of shared glossary terms

terms:
  - term: Assertion
    definition: A statement in a credential about a person's achievement.
  - term: Competency Framework
    definition: An instance of a logically related set of competencies, knowledge, skills, abilities, or other attributes (KSAOs). When they are stored in accessible formats, they can be easily used across systems.
  - term: Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR)
    definition: CLR is 1) a standard format for issuing multiple achievements as a single credential. The CLR standard version 2.0 can contain Open Badges (version 3.0) and other credentials including transcripts. 2) A credential issued in this format. Some wallets can now store CLRs in them. 
  - term: Credential
    definition: We use the World Wide Web Consortium's broad definition of credential to mean anything that proves something about a person, i.e. qualification, competency, or clearance. This includes someone's identity, license, diploma, work eligibility, badge, certification, etc.
  - term: Digital Wallet
    definition: A digital credential wallet is software that helps individuals store, manage, and share their educational, work, and other credentials. Digital wallets should be interoperable, meaning individuals can easily import and export their standards-compliant credentials without losing information.It operates in a similar way to a physical wallet that holds money, important documents, and identification.
  - term: Evidence
    definition: Any links, multimedia, work samples, assessment results, or other documentation provided with a credential that supports its credibility and value.
  - term: Interoperability
    definition: The ability of different devices, software, or systems to successfully talk to each other. Interoperability is a characteristic of a product or system to work with other products or systems.
  - term: Issuer
    definition: An organization or person who creates a credential.
  - term: Learning and Employment Record (LER)
    definition: LER is a category that describes a record or collection of records relevant to education, hiring, and advancement. The current best practice for LERs for the purpose of skills-based hiring and advancement is for LERs to meet a set of criteria that supports their usefulness for representing a person's qualifications interoperably (across different organizations systems, including HR systems, education systems, and online profiles). Yet, this list of criteria is still aspirational. Issuing credentials as the latest versions of CLR, Open Badge, or W3C Verifiable Credential is a great step towards meeting these criteria. These credentials can be stored in digital wallets and easily moved between them.
  - term: Micro-credential
    definition: While there is little agreement on the definition of a microcredential, AACRAO suggests&#x3b; A microcredential is generally a subset of learning achievements or outcomes that is less than a full degree or certificate. Ideally they are stackable and demonstrate earning criteria" (AACRAO, 2022).
  - term: Open Data Standard
    definition: Open data standards are agreements that establish a consistent way to create, use, and share dataâ€¦ Ideally, open standards are free/low-cost, consistent, create portable data, are openly-governed, interoperable, useful, and structured. Open data standards are just the [data] formats being made available, not the data itself" (Learning Economy Foundation, 2022). 
  - term: Open Data Standard
    definition: Digital badges which are awarded using the Open Badge standard.
  - term: Verification
    definition: Often appears as a green checkmark on a credential that ensures no fraud has occurred since it was issued and that the credential belongs to whoever is sharing it. This checkmark appears upon loading the credential or on demand to represent that the software has just checked the credential's real-time integrity. It is not a representation of the quality of the credential's contents.
  - term: Verifiable Credential
    definition: 1) A credential that can be verified using the definition of verification above. 2) The name of the data standard from the World Wide Web Consortium that guarantees a credential is tamper evident, interoperable, and provides multiple options for disclosing all or selective parts of the credential contents, at the discretion of the credential holder. The CLR 2.0 and Open Badge 3.0 are compatible with this standard and more compatible standards are coming soon.
  - term: Verifier
    definition: Typically an employer or other organization which wants to check that a credential is real.
