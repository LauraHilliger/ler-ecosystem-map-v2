                <div class="body-text-medium header explained">Learning and Employment Records (LERs) are digital records of a personâ€™s jobs and skills acquired through education, credentialing, in the workplace, and through service and life experience. The records are verifiable and secured according to web standards, and are controlled by users, who can curate and use them to pursue educational and employment opportunities as they see fit.</div>

                        <div class="body-text-medium">Education and hiring tools and technologies, especially those focused on leveraging skills, are advancing rapidly, but hiring practices still rely heavily on pdf resumes, references and other proxies; all of which provide an incomplete picture of candidates. This can result in poor matches between talent and jobs, and often locks people into one particular vendor or platform. Without taking intentional steps to establish a more equitable and interoperable LER ecosystem for capturing, verifying, and sharing information about learning, employment and service, it is likely that new technologies will perpetuate inequitable access to meaningful education and jobs.<br/><br/>We believe LERs are a tool with the potential to help increase economic mobility for all. Giving learners and earners control over their data empowers them to use it to access opportunities e.g. to determine eligibility for benefits, to market their relevant skills to apply for jobs, and choose the skills they want to share absent of data that may trigger biases. <br/><br/>For employers, LERs can offer data rich predictors of performance and help ensure that time spent on upskilling and reskilling is responsive to workforce needs.
